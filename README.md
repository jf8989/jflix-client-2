# J-Flix Angular Client (J-Flix 2.0) üé¨

This project is the Angular-based frontend client for the j-Flix application. It allows users to browse movies, manage their profiles, and keep track of their favorite films.

This application interacts with the [j-Flix API](<Your API Repo URL - Add Link Here>) for data and authentication.

## Live Demo ‚ú®

## Features üöÄ

*   **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login forms presented in dialogs.
*   **Movie Browsing:** Displays a list of movies fetched from the API in responsive cards on the main `/movies` route.
*   **Detailed Movie View:** Clicking on a movie's image opens a modal dialog (`MovieViewDialogComponent`) displaying comprehensive details:
    *   Full Poster Image
    *   Synopsis/Description
    *   Rating and Year
    *   Director Information (Name, Bio)
    *   Genre Information
    *   Ability to Add/Remove from Favorites directly within the dialog.
*   **Quick Info Dialogs:** Buttons on the main movie cards provide quick access to specific details via dialogs:
    *   Genre Details (`GenreDialogComponent`)
    *   Director Details (`DirectorDialogComponent`)
    *   Synopsis (`SynopsisDialogComponent`)
*   **Favorites Management:** Allows users to add or remove movies from their personal favorites list (via main card icon or detail dialog button). Favorite status is persisted via the API and reflected visually.
*   **User Profile:** Dedicated view (`/profile`) for users to see and update their profile information (Email, Birthday, Password). Option to deregister the account.
*   **Responsive Design:** Built with Angular Material to ensure usability across different screen sizes (mobile-first approach).
*   **Routing:** Utilizes Angular Router for navigation between Welcome (`/welcome`), Movies (`/movies`), and Profile (`/profile`) views.

## Backend API Connection üîå

This frontend application consumes the j-Flix REST API hosted at:
`https://j-flix-omega.vercel.app`

## Getting Started üîß

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js and npm (Check versions using `node -v` and `npm -v`)
*   Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

**Installation & Running Locally:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-angular-repo-url>
    cd J-Flix-Angular-client
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    ng serve --open
    ```
    Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any source files.

*(Ensure the backend API is running and accessible for the application to function correctly).*

## Building for Production üì¶

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/j-flix-angular-client` directory.

## Running Unit Tests üß™

To execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io):

```bash
ng test
```

*(Note: End-to-end tests are not configured in this project setup).*

## Code Documentation (TypeDoc) üìö

Detailed documentation for the Angular components, services, and methods has been generated using TypeDoc.

**To view the documentation:**

1.  Ensure you have run `npm install` to install dev dependencies (including `typedoc`).
2.  Generate the documentation (if not already present):
    ```bash
    npx typedoc src/app --out docs/typedoc --entryPointStrategy expand
    ```
3.  Open the generated `docs/typedoc/index.html` file in your web browser.

## Deployment ‚òÅÔ∏è

This application is automatically deployed to Vercel upon pushes to the main branch.
